## <li>A Novel Approach for Recognizing Weak Fractures in Hydraulic Fracturing of Rock Core</li>

## INTRODUCTION
<ul><li><strong>Fracture identification and quantitative analysis in core-scale hydraulic fracturing experiments represent a critical technical approach for in-depth investigation of fracture initiation, propagation, and spatial distribution patterns during hydraulic fracturing. Hydraulic fractures typically exhibit low contrast, indistinct boundaries, and high discontinuity, rendering conventional fracture detection methods effective primarily for strong fractures but limited in identifying weaker fractures. To address these limitations associated with weak fractures, this study proposes a novel identification approach consisting of four principal stages: (1) data preprocessing, involving fracture enhancement and noise-reduction filtering; (2) precise fracture extraction using the ant-tracking algorithm; (3) fracture classification employing a clustering algorithm to effectively distinguish strong from weak fractures; and (4) reconstruction of the three-dimensional fracture model of rock cores by integrating both strong and weak fractures. To validate the performance and reliability of the proposed approach, fracture identification was conducted on two shale core samples from the Longmaxi Formation using multiple fracture recognition techniques. Comparative analysis indicates that the proposed approach significantly outperforms conventional thresholding and level-set methods by effectively enhancing the visibility of weak fracture information and accurately preserving fracture details. Thus, the proposed method demonstrates superior effectiveness and robustness for identifying weak fractures in rock core experiments.</strong></li></ul>
